<b>FINITE LOGIC: CacheSense - Predictive Eviction Layer</b>

CacheSense replaces traditional reactive cache policies (LRU, LFU) with a predictive, machine-learning-inspired algorithm. It calculates a "Usefulness Score" for every cached item based on frequency, recency, and access volatility to determine the absolute best item to evict.

<b>Solved Problem: </b>

Increases the cache hit rate significantly beyond basic policies, drastically reducing load on expensive backing services (databases, APIs). This provides a substantial performance and cost advantage for high-traffic applications.
